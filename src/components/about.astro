  <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
  <p class="text-foreground leading-relaxed">
    I'm Shay Henderson, a Software and Infrastructure Engineer with more than six years of experience across software development, cloud infrastructure, QA, and technical support.
    I've implemented scalable web and mobile solutions, maintained near-perfect uptime across cloud platforms, and improved customer experience through data-driven problem solving and structured processes.
    My work bridges technical, operational, and customer-facing domains: from building Next.js applications and managing GCP infrastructure, to authoring 150+ help articles reaching 60,000+ readers annually.
    I'm skilled at delivering reliable, high-quality outcomes that balance performance, usability, and maintainability.
