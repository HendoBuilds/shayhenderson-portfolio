            My Journey
          </h2>
          <div class="space-y-6 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            <p>
              I'm Shay Henderson, a Software and Infrastructure Engineer with more than six years of experience spanning software development, cloud infrastructure, quality assurance, and technical support operations.
            </p>
            <p>
              My journey began in enterprise IT, where I delivered tier-1 through tier-3 support for complex Windows and cloud environments. I deployed servers, managed Active Directory infrastructure, implemented backup and disaster recovery solutions with Veeam, and automated system administration tasks using PowerShell. This foundation taught me how technology systems interconnect and how to solve critical issues under pressure.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since 2022, I've been working at JPG Store, a large-scale NFT marketplace serving hundreds of thousands of users across web and mobile platforms. In this role, I've led the migration from a custom ticketing system to a fully integrated Intercom platform with AI-powered automation that achieved a 64.6% deflection rate while maintaining 90.2% customer satisfaction.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've authored and maintained over 150 technical and support articles that reach more than 60,000 unique readers each year. I contribute to the Next.js frontend development, oversee QA workflows, and help maintain 99% platform uptime across Google Cloud Platform and Cloudflare infrastructure with sub-two-minute average response times.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most recently, I contracted with SecurityBot to lead a comprehensive professional rework of their GitBook documentation, transforming it from a hobbyist reference into a structured, production-ready knowledge base.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm skilled at bridging technical, operational, and customer-facing domains to deliver reliable, high-quality outcomes. Whether it's building scalable web applications, managing cloud infrastructure, or creating comprehensive documentation, my focus is on measurable impact, performance, and long-term sustainability.

                Years of frontline technical support taught me to identify root causes quickly and build solutions that address real, recurring issues. Every project starts with understanding the environment, the users, and the problem itself.
